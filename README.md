# MiniCountryFlag

MiniCountryFlag is a tiny PHP class that converts ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes (like `FI`, `US`, `JP`) into flag emojis (ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡® ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ).  
Perfect for small projects, websites, or any application that needs to display country flags from ISO codes in a lightweight way.
